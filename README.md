# üß® 30-Day Delphi-for-Malware Challenge

A hands-on, ADHD-friendly roadmap to get operational with Delphi for malware development and red teaming. Focused on short, impactful tasks with immediate feedback.  
This is just a repo blueprint created using ChatGPT 4o because I was lazy.  
Feel free to clone and push your own solutions.  
I will publish my own experimentations in a branch other than main.  
Maybe later on a "solutions" or "answer" branch will be available.  

## üî∞ Week 1: Delphi Basics & Environment

**Day 1:** Install Delphi Community Edition + Hello World Console App  
**Day 2:** Create a GUI with a fake "Installer" button  
**Day 3:** Read & Write files on disk (simulate payload drop)  
**Day 4:** Launch `cmd.exe` via `WinExec()`  
**Day 5:** Use `MessageBox()` as basic implant signal  
**Day 6:** Create a simple XOR encoder/decoder  
**Day 7:** Compile in different modes (console/gui), play with settings

## ü¶æ Week 2: WinAPI and Payloads

**Day 8:** Use `GetModuleHandle`, `GetProcAddress`, `VirtualAlloc`  
**Day 9:** Write a manual PE loader (just stub the shell)  
**Day 10:** Load and execute XOR-encrypted shellcode from memory  
**Day 11:** Change section names using PE editing tool  
**Day 12:** Add persistence via Registry key (HKCU Run)  
**Day 13:** Create a fake GUI form that does something in the background  
**Day 14:** Compile + run your implant in Ludus lab

## üëª Week 3: Obfuscation & Stealth

**Day 15:** Use UPX to pack your Delphi binary  
**Day 16:** Strip debug info, change PE timestamps  
**Day 17:** Modify import table manually (static linking reduction)  
**Day 18:** Add fake PE sections via PE-Bear  
**Day 19:** Use Delphi‚Äôs `TMemoryStream` to decrypt payload  
**Day 20:** Add random delays and junk code blocks  
**Day 21:** Run under Defender to test detection

## üï∑Ô∏è Week 4: Payload Deployment & Analysis Resistance

**Day 22:** Build an HTTP downloader in Delphi  
**Day 23:** Build a fake installer that drops + executes  
**Day 24:** Add mutex check to prevent re-execution  
**Day 25:** Implement basic anti-debug (IsDebuggerPresent)  
**Day 26:** Write encrypted config file to disk (simulate C2)  
**Day 27:** Encrypt the binary payload using custom XOR stub  
**Day 28:** Bundle into Nim loader for layered obfuscation  
**Day 29:** Test against Windows 11 with logging enabled  
**Day 30:** Record behavior in a sandbox (Cuckoo, CAPEv2)

üéØ Outcome:
- Functional shellcode loader
- C2-aware dropper
- Basic crypter
- Operational evasion stack

Save snapshots. Take notes. Break things.
