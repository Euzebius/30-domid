# üß® 30-Day Delphi-for-Malware Challenge

A hands-on, ADHD-friendly roadmap to get operational with Delphi for malware development and red teaming. Focused on short, impactful tasks with immediate feedback.  
This is just a repo blueprint created using ChatGPT 4o because I was lazy.  
Feel free to clone and push your own solutions.  
I will publish my own experimentations in a branch other than main.  
Maybe later on a "solutions" or "answer" branch will be available.  

## üî∞ Week 1: Delphi Basics & Environment

Day 1: Install Delphi CE + Hello World  
Day 2: Fake Installer GUI  
Day 3: File I/O (Read & Write)  
Day 4: Launch cmd.exe  
Day 5: MessageBox signaling  
Day 6: XOR encode/decode  
Day 7: Compile modes (console/gui)

## ü¶æ Week 2: WinAPI and Payloads

Day 8: WinAPI Basics (VirtualAlloc etc)  
Day 9: Manual PE Loader stub  
Day 10: Shellcode loader (XOR decrypt)  
Day 11: PE section renaming  
Day 12: Registry persistence  
Day 13: Fake GUI with background action  
Day 14: Deploy implant in lab

## üëª Week 3: Obfuscation & Stealth

Day 15: UPX packing  
Day 16: Strip debug info
